# NiceSnippet-Postman-Codegen

A *hacky?* tool to get Postman to generate custom code without diving into the internals.

## How do I use this?
### Method 1:
1. Get/Open a successfully working postman request.
2. Use Pre-Requisite tab to show code editor
3. Run the code `console.log(pm.request)`.
4. Open up console. Copy output and paste into webapp.
5. Generated code shows up on output box.


### Method 2
1. Get/Open a successfully working postman request.
2. Upload scripts on google appscript.
3. Deploy as Webapp/API.
4. Post Postman request to the API as Json stringified object.
5. Generated code shows up on Response box.
