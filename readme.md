# NiceSnippet-Postman-Codegen

A *hacky?* tool to get Postman to generate custom code without diving into the internals.

## How do I use this?
1. Get/Open a successfully working postman request.
2. Download a released build and copy the code contents.
3. Open the Tests tab
4. Paste in the code.
5. Hit Send
6. Open Console
7. Copy the output.
8. Optional - Clear console before sending a new request.
